Lectio Venetiarum

Opening Monologue

Welcome townsfolk to Basilica Santa Maria della Salute, my name is Padre Teodoro Lombardi and I have some sickening news. This evening at 9 oâ€™clock a local spinster attended a Tarot reading, shameful I know. On her route home she was brutally murdered, she was found with her throat slit, and the cards the Moon, Death and the Three of Swords placed in her coat pocket. This is said to be death and a rather grizzly one at that, I need your help to find this murderer and prevent any further casualties. 

Gameplay

Based on blood on the clock tower mixed with wolf/vampire etc and elements of dnd. There is a storyteller narrating the path of the game. 11 Other players for a maximum game consisting of 2 teams, good and evil. In a max game 3 evil roles are in play and 2 for anything lower than 9 players. The game is round based, during the day dead and alive Townsfolk may intermingle and discuss roles with other players. Once players are called to gather there will be a vote on who should be executed or not. Over half the players need to successfully vote for a player to be executed. Each player gets one nomination and the vote needs to exceed one if they want another player to be executed instead. There is only one execution per day. Each dead player gets one last vote but alive players may vote as many or as little as they want each round. Each night players will close their eyes and go to sleep, they will be tapped on the shoulder by the Padre one by one if they have a night ability to do the actions needed before closing their eyes. Be aware for some unknown reason you may not be awoken at all. The game starts during the day and continues until the murderer is executed or there are equal to or more evil then good players. Ave Maria to be played during the night. You awake in the morning to see who has died and at the end of the game the story is retold with the hidden truths and the players are given their readings.
